# Software Vulnerability Datasets

A collection of datasets composed of software vulnerability metadata scraped from [CVE Details](https://www.cvedetails.com/), software metrics and security alerts generated by Static Analysis Tools (SATs), and version control metadata retrieved from each project's repository. Each line represents a C/C++ code unit (file, function, or class) and is associated with a binary label (non-vulnerable or vulnerable) and multiclass label (non-vulnerable, vulnerable without a security category, or vulnerable within a category).

Two types of datasets are provided for three kinds of C/C++ code units:

* `raw-dataset-merged-*`: a compressed archive that contains the complete dataset with the information described above.

* `propheticus-dataset-*`: a compressed archive that contains three text files - a stripped down version of the previous dataset that can be parsed by the [Propheticus](http://www.joaorcampos.com/ISSRE-2019/) tool (`*.data.txt`), a JSON file with the name and data type of each dataset column (`*.headers.txt`), and a file with the total number of samples in the dataset (`*.info.txt`).
